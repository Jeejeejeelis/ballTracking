# Ball Tracking

Working on `ballTracking.py`.

## Next Steps

1. ~~Start video when the rally has started!~~
2. Try to make better ball detection with current filters.
    ~~2.1. Add higher contrast~~
    ~~2.2. Add sharpening kernel~~  

3. Add HSV filter to look for ball color for additional detection.
    - If circle detected, then ball should be green.
4. HoughCircle expects hollow circle -> hollow my masked ball by finding the perimeters of it!
