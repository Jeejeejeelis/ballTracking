## Dependencies

This project relies on the following libraries and frameworks:

- **Python**: The programming language used for this project.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: A library used for real-time computer vision.
- **NumPy**: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **Torch**: An open-source machine learning library, a scientific computing framework, and a script language based on the Lua programming language.
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8**: A minimal implementation of YOLOv8 in PyTorch.
- **Project-specific modules**: These include `color`, `draw`, `detect`, `mask`, and `calibrationMask`.

Please ensure that you have the correct versions of these dependencies to avoid any compatibility issues.
